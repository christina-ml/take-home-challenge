Hover mouse over the button:

<button type="buttons" class="clickable">Show Project Instructions</button>

<div class="instructions">
  <p>
  Hovering over the button will change this text. Something really cool is that JavaScript is actually going to replace this text using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText" target="_blank">innerText</a> property!
  <br>
  First, I created a variable (named it "instruct") to select the div that holds this text that you're reading right now.  using the class I named it called "instructions".

  <p id="fun-fact-description">
    Not only am I interested in learning how to code, I'm also a textile designer! I am involved in the whole process from creating trends, color palettes, choosing artwork from art studios or creating original artwork of my own to put onto products. Then the new designs get sent off to factories overseas, and they print the designs onto fabrics or weave them, and turn them into products you find around your home:

    <!--   bullet points list   -->
  <ul>
    <li>Bedding, sheets, decorative pillows</li>
    <li>throw blankets</li>
    <li>window curtains</li>
    <li>shower curtains, towels, bath rugs</li>
    <li>and more!</li>
    </li>
  </ul>
  This is all done on the computer using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
    </p>
 <h2 id="fun-header">Fun Fact #2!</h2>
<p id="fun-fact-description">
    I am an artist, so I also like to do crafts and knit. I've knit all sorts of things! I've made: scarves, hats, sweaters, a vest, mittens, wrist mitts, pillow covers, a teapot mitten, and much more! Recently, I've been making a few shawls! They take a very long time, but they are so warm. During COVID-19 I learned how to use a cable needle, and made a hat with cables. Looks amazing!</br>Also really getting into color changing patterns such as fair isle, where I now have 3 hats from <a  href="https://www.shetlandwoolweek.com/" target="_blank">Shetland Wool Week</a>. So much fun, so much yarn, and of course there's always <a href="https://youtu.be/XygPZ2cWBeA" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a> to help for difficult knitting techniques such as: make 1 right, and make 1 left (triangular shawls tend to use these every other row). The stitches will be leaning towards either the right, or the left! Increases, decreases, and fixing mistakes is all part of it. Sometimes you even find a hole where you've accidentally dropped a stitch and need to go find a crochet hook to loop it back in. Kind of like de-bugging code when you get an error, but with yarn.

    This was the group project where I worked together in a team of 2 other participants, and a volunteer observed. We created this code collaboratively, and shared our ideas and ways to re-create the example newspaper page. I thought we did a great job! It wasn't finished, but we at least got a good start on it, and came up with the ideas ourselves. <a href="https://codepen.io/christinaml/pen/KKabYqe" target="_blank">Group Project</a> to re-create a newspaper.</br></br>
We were able to use HTML and CSS to do this!

    </br></br>    
    I took some time after the workshop to go back and revise the newspaper page to look even better. There was limited time during the workshop, but it was great to see different ideas on how we each thought about setting up the page. I changed the fonts, and used CSS Grid to help separate the sections.

This looks more like the example now! It's in HTML and CSS, but could use some JavaScript in the future!
